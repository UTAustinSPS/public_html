		<h3>Week One</h3>
		<p>
			An introduction to the LaTeX programming language that is used throughout physics for composing scientific papers. How to install LaTeX and some basics about the language.

		<h3>Week Two</h3>
		<p>Document classes, basic math formatting, basic pictures, tables, and matrices. This section makes sure you
		get familiar with how to write code in LaTeX with some of the most common structures seen for images and math.

		<a href="Assignment1.pdf">Assignment 1 (PDF)</a> - basic math, images, tables, and matrices.
		<br>
		<p>We also put together a "similar" document to help out if you're having trouble completing assignment 1. We've
		included the LaTeX document and the resultant PDF so you can see what does what. Those are, respectively,
		<a href="Assignment1Sample.tex">Sample 1 (TeX)</a> and <a href="Assignment1Sample.pdf">Sample 1 (PDF)</a>. As always,
		if you have questions, email the SPS officers at <a href="mailto:spsofficers@gmail.com">spsofficers@gmail.com</a>.
		</p>

		<h3>Week Three</h3>
		<p>This week's presentation covers the material from last week briefly with some example code. Then, we discuss
			several aspects of formatting that show up regularly. Most of these could become part of your template,
			but some may change from time to time. Specifically, we cover references (equations, figures) and citations,
			then how to format equations and images, followed by lists and the section structure of documents. Finally,
			we describe how to make LaTeX customizable to the extent of the intermediate user. The advanced user might
			create whole packages for extremely complex code, which we will not discuss in our seminar.</p>
