      <p><font face="Helvetica">This is a helpful little pamphlet put together by SPS members
      several years ago. It is not necessarily up to date anymore, but does have some useful

    <h3><font face="Arial">SPS Membership Information</font></h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Helvetica">During the spring, local dues were not
required. This
may change in the future, but for now this means that all it takes to be a
      member is to let one of the officers know that
      you're interested, and then you're instantly in. We also do not require that you be a
      member at the national level, though it is preferred, and we think you'll like the benefit
      of receiving Physics Today. To apply for the national organization, please pick up a form
      from on top of the filing cabinet in the SPS lounge (RLM 5.222) and send it to the listed
      address, along with $15.00.</p>
