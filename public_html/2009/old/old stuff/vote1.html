    following people have been nominated to serve as officers in the Society of Physics
    Students for the '99-'00 school year.&nbsp; Elections this year will be run as follows:
    each SPS member is allowed to submit <big><big>1</big></big> vote for upto four officers
    by sending his/her vote to <a href="mailto:sps@physics.utexas.edu">sps@physics.utexas.edu</a>.
    You will not be voting for individual officer positions, just for the four people you
    believe are best qualified/capable of fulfilling an official leadership role. The exact
    positions will be figured out later. Each nominee has been asked to submit a statement
    about why they wish to be an officer and/or ideas for the organization. These are listed
    below in alphabetical order. No specific instructions have been given, so each one is
    somewhat different in approach...</p>

    <p>As we face the future, we must decide what we hope to accomplish as a student
    organization and to continue to define our purpose for existence. Shall we exist merely as
    a status organization, yet another item to add to one's resume? Or shall we become an
    active and vital part of both the Department of Physics and the campus in general? I think
    the following are suitable goals for our chapter of the Society of Physics Students: <ol>
      <li>To provide a focal point for socialization amongst physics majors. </li>
      <li>To help encourage retention of freshman physics majors; it is probably likely that not a
        few potential physics majors left us due to a lack of support. Our future depends on this,
        for how shall we continue if there is nobody to continue? </li>
      <li>To work with the K-12 community to advocate physics and physics teaching. This semester,
        Science Fun Day was an effective way of implementing this goal. These children are our
        future as citizens and scientists. We should therefore have some hand in recruitment
        efforts, since they will be the scientists and policy makers of tomorrow. </li>
      <li>To act as a liaison between faculty and undergraduates, especially for promoting
        undergraduate research. While looking through our archives, I noticed that SPS in the past
        has managed to get the faculty to give talks with regards to this subject. This is
        something that should be reinstituted. </li>
      <li>To get as many members as possible involved with the functions of SPS. Our chapter
        by-laws call for the existence of three standing committees: Program/Publicity, Social,
        and Candidates for Membership. Committees, by very definition and scope, are limited, and
        thereby provide a potentially effective way of focusing efforts on issues at hand. </li>
      <li>To reinstitute regular open meetings during the semester, at a time agreeable and
        convenient to as many members as possible. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>I think that these are significant goals and challenges, which we should focus our
    attention on, as a student group, and which I plan to devote my attention to, if I am
    selected to become an officer elect.</p>

    <p>I would like to be an SPS officer because I am a dedicated physics student and I
    believe that I can help mold an organization that everyone interested in physics would
    want to be a part of. I have been an involved member as I have attended all SPS meetings
    and social functions; in addition I have carried out the obligations of the officers when
    they have been unable to do so (arranging the lighting of the torch at the Hex rally this
    year). I know very well what it takes to maintain an organization such as the SPS as I
    helped to found another college organization here, the Texas State Senior Classical
    League. And, since I have two years left at UT, I will not be taking time consuming
    courses such as senior lab that might get in the way of my duties as an officer.</p>

    <font SIZE="2"><p></font><font size="3">Hi, my name is Eric. I&#146;m the guy with the
    hat. I&#146;m the SPS secretary. Vote for me.</p>
    <p>Now that that&#146;s out of the way, I&#146;ve got a little something to say. I used to
    be running, just because I thought it would be fun to be an officer, that&#146;s still my
    primary reason, however as of the last meeting I have an ideological motive as well. I
    want to be President to protect your Personal Freedom. I know that sounds like a bunch of
    crap, but here's the deal. There are people in this organization that think you need to
    participate in SPS activities. There is nothing wrong with this. However, they want these
    (sometimes) pointless activities to become &quot;Official SPS functions&quot;. This is not
    right. Being a physics major is hard work for some of us and if I ,as a potential member,
    felt that I was obligated to participate in some extra-curricular activity to be a member
    of SPS I would probably not join. Now that may just be me, but I don&#146;t think this is
    the way to bring in new blood. And guess what, we could use new members, the old ones are
    getting a little graduated.</p>
    <p>It is my position (and my only platform plank other than vote for me 'cause I'm fun)
    that if you want to throw yourself into everything Pat hears about, great! Put it on your
    resume and get into Princeton Grad School. However, if I'm SPS President you won&#146;t
    have to do anything. If you want to we&#146;ll help, but if you don&#146;t you&#146;re
    still welcome. We make announcements, we arrange car pools for the transportation-less, we
    plan the spring Physnic. The end. And, if you want &quot;Official&quot; functions, how
    about the Colloquium (Wed 4-5, RLM 4.102). That's real physics. Thanks. </p>

    <p>Why am I running for an officer position?</p>
    <p>Because I think that SPS can be an organization that actually does something. For
    Science Fun Day and UT Interactive we had over a dozen physics majors who designed
    activities for kids, spoke to the public and in general had a good time showing off UT
    Physics. These people have told me that they're interested in doing SFD again, and in
    doing more. Without officers who care enough to actually organize events or convince
    others to do so, SPS will become nothing more than a study lounge. People will join, and
    never think of it again. I have already shown that I can organize activities and find
    others to help. I've spoken with Tim and Ken (sorry about advertising for them, but they
    also want to see SPS become an active organization) and we've come up with a list of
    activities we'd like to organize. We have ideas, and the drive to see them through. </p>
    <p>What is there for an SPS officer to do? Some people may think that an SPS officer has
    nothing to do. That is only the case, however, if the officer wants that to be the case.
    SPS can host social events (beyond the physnic) to help interest freshman and sophomore
    physics majors, which will in turn increase the pool from which to draw people for other
    activities. We can have service activities, such as tutoring, that will help spread SPS'
    name and maybe help more people see that physics majors fit stereotypes about as well as
    people in other majors do. Organizing events isn't an unbearable burden. With enough
    advance notice, people can and will make time in their schedules. An hour a week from an
    officer can lead to parties, high school visits, and a better time in college for physics
    majors. These things can happen if an officer sets aside the time to make them happen.
    I've done so this year, and I can do so again next year.</p>
    <p><big>Tim Riedel</big></p>
    <p>I think that SPS should be more than a lounge. The attitude among some current officers
    that there isn't enough time for that stinks. I think that SPS can serve a very useful
    function at the University. Right now just about everyone who takes a physics course at UT
    comes out of it hating physics. This is bad for them and for us as physics majors. I think
    SPS can work with the department to help figure out what to do to make Freshman physics
    worth while. Something as simple as SPS arranging free tutoring will help show everyone
    that even if the physics material sucks, physics majors aren't all that bad. Improving the
    image of the physics department as seen by the rest of the University should be the major
    goal of the Society of Physics Students for the next few years. We know physics majors are
    cool, it's time for everyone else to know it too. Sure we can't change the department
    overnight but we can start making an impact on the University now. To accomplish this we
    need people who are willing to at least try to get out there and do something. If you went
    to the election meeting you saw that some current officers are great at making excuses. I
    have no tolerance for this and neither should you. So vote for me (Tim), Geoff, Ken and
    Chris if you want SPS to actually do something. These are the people who get stuff done, I
    know, I was there when we put together Science Fun Day in one night. </p>
    <p><big>Ralph Robinett (current vice president)</big></p>
    <p>Ok, I am the vice-president this year, and by popular demand I have been nominated to
    run again. Here is something I think would be beneficial to all. We should establish a
    list in the SPS Lounge with all members names, email address, and areas of
    interest/expertise. This way people will be able to find other members with either similar
    interests or get help in some aspect of physics from someone you may or may not know that
    well.&nbsp; People who need help with say writing a computer program would then be able to
    go to the list and see who is knowledgeable in LabVIEW programming, for example. Well,
    those are my ideas. Talk to me if you have any other questions or suggestions, and by all
    means vote for me. </p>
    <p><big>Ken Tatebe</big></p>
    <p>I found Austin Science Fun Day to be very interesting and enriching. I would like to
    see more events like this. It seems that it is not acceptable to force the society to have
    more events and make its officers work. Be that as it may, I have a personal interest in
    seeing more events organized through SPS. Since SPS is unable to ensure that its officers
    will work hard to make SPS better I will guarantee that I will work. If those of you who
    know me think that I will do a better job than was done this year then vote for me. I have
    a good deal of experience with HTML and know some Java. If you have seen my webpages then
    you know that I can do a good job upkeeping the SPS webpage.</p>
    <p><big>Brandon Wilson (current treasurer)</big></p>
    <font SIZE="2"><p></font><font size="3">There has been a lot of talk about the lack of
    activity in the SPS. This is understandable since, the SPS has only been involved in two
    major activities this semester. The answer to why the SPS is not greatly involved in extra
    curricular activities has never truly been discussed. The claim that the SPS is not very
    active is made with a comparison to what? Is it other organizations? Other organizations,
    on average, have the resources to be much more active than the SPS. There are two reasons
    for this:<ol>
      <li>Other organizations have many more members. I am speaking, of course, of organizations
        with members belonging to a single department at UT. If you bother to check the number of
        students in the physics department against the number of students in most other
        departments, you will notice a large difference.</li>
      <li>Students in many other departments at UT tend to have more time, on average. We all know
        that physics can be very time consuming.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>It is reason number two that prevents many SPS members from participating in events
    such as Science Fun Day. On top of class work, many physics students also work in
    laboratories. Participation in extra curricular events will only pick up if the amount of
    free time for students increases or the number of SPS members increases. Forcing anyone,
    in the SPS, to participate in extra curricular events would be inherently unethical. We
    are here to become good physicists; to do this we must put our class work and lab work
    first. I, for one, believe that we should participate more in outside events but, not at
    the cost of our goals here at UT. Instead, I propose that we compile a list of SPS members
    listing their skills and specialties (in the area of lab work). Inclusion on the list must
    be on a volunteer basis only. If someone has a problem in a particular area he/she can
    check the list and contact the person best suited to help. Those of us who are able and
    interested in promoting outside activities are greatly encouraged to do so.</p>
    <p>As your treasurer I would like to enact the following money-earning activities:<ol>
      <li>Production and sale of an SPS and/or physics shirt. T-shirts would be the least
        expensive to the buyer. Design of t-shirt by majority vote. </li>
      <li>Collection of dues from members ever semester (NO ONE EXCLUDED). To be fair, members
        must see some of these dues go towards events/activities that they want. Meetings or email
        polling will allow members to decide on events/activities that money is to be spent on.
        Any SPS member is allowed to suggest an event or activity but if SPS money is to be spent
        a majority vote of members will be required. A majority vote means more yeas than nays. </li>
      <li>Possible fund-raising activities. We could always sell doughnuts. This would depend on
        whether or not enough people are willing to do it. I will not force anyone away from his
        or her task at hand. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>The money earned will allow us to do many things since maintenance of the SPS room is
    our only overhead. The aforementioned ideas can become a reality with only a single vote.</p>
    <p>Vote for Brandon Wilson &#150; SPS treasurer</font></td>
