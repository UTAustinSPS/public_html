<h2>About SPS at UT Austin:</h2>
The Society of Physics
Students is a student run organization
that
promotes engagement and collaboration between fellow students of
physics at UT Austin. Our regular meetings, every Thursday at 5 pm in
RLM 7.104,
allow new and old members to make new connections, to learn from
special lectures and to participate in events around the department and
around campus.
<p>
Chances are you are already
a member, as membership is
automatic for
majors, requires no dues and comes with the benefit of free food at
meetings. Even if you are not a physics major, you are encouraged to
attend our meetings if you are interested in physics or people in
physics. If you have questions, come by our next meeting or get in
touch with one of the officers.
<p>
You can also meet us and
other physics majors every day in the
<a href="../room/room.html">Physics Undergraduate Lounge</a>
in RLM 5.222. The room is maintained in part by the SPS.</p>
<h2>Contact</h2>
If you have any questions, get in touch with one of the officers: <a href="hayleym@mail.utexas.edu">Hayley Manning</a>, <a href="s.a.sevier@gmail.com">Stuart Sevier</a>, <a href="bobtbell@gmail.com">Bob Bell</a>.
