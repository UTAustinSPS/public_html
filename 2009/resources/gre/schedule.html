<BODY LANG="en-US" DIR="LTR">
Weekly group problem sessions are held where we can share the task of tracking down good practice problems and share mental resources in figuring out the best way to tackle them.
 It seems that a very structured approach might work best for these weekly sessions, so the schedule is below, divided into sections corresponding to the subject weightings of The Test.
 Many weeks, we will have faculty on hand to facilitate.
<p>
For each topic, attendees are asked to come prepared to present a few relevant problems they've found or invented in the preceeding week.
We'll ask that everyone bring 2 or 3 problems to the meeting that you either could not solve or found difficult to solve to see if anyone can come up with a faster/better method or that you solved so elegantly that you know we're all dying to see them.
We'll all benefit the most if the problems come from a variety of sources but are similar in form or length to a typical GRE question.
 At the weekly meeting, we'll go around the room taking turns leading a problem.
<p>
Weekly problem sessions probably won't be enough for most of us and many people benefit from studying in groups (or at least committing to a time and place).
 In order to make it easier to find motivation / people to study with, we've agreed on several nights and times where people can congregate at student-friendly coffee shops to prepare for the coming week's problem session.
