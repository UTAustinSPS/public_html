<h1>Society of Physics Students (SPS)</h1>
<h3>at the University of Texas at Austin</h3>
<p>The Society of Physics Students is a student run organization that promotes engagement and collaboration between fellow students of physics at UT Austin. Our regular meetings, on alternating Tuesdays, allow new and old members to make new connections, to learn from special lectures and to participate in events around the department and around campus.</p>
<p>Chances are you are already a member, as membership is automatic for majors, requires no dues and comes with the benefit of free food at meetings. Even if you are not a physics major, you are encouraged to attend our meetings if you are interested in physics or people in physics. If you have questions, come by our next meeting or get in touch with one of the officers.</p>
<p>You can also meet us and other physics majors every day in the <a href="lounge.html">Physics Undergraduate Lounge</a> in RLM 5.222. The room is maintained in part by the SPS.</p>

Come to the department's spring semester picnic! Barbecue (and vegetarian options) catered by Dagar's, assorted "beverages," sports and good times on the last day of class. Tickets are cheap this year, only $3, as they are sponsored by W.W. Norton and Co. Buy them from SPS officers or from Pat Morgan in RLM 5.216.

<b>Survival guide</b><br />
The <a href="survival/index.shtml">Physics Survival Guide</a> is an antique scroll passed down unmodified through generations. Amid its delightful anachronisms, such as registering by telephone and dialup internet access tips, you may find some tidbits of physics advice that still apply. Want to budge the monolith?
