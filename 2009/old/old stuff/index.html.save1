    <font face="Helvetica">
    <p>The purpose of this page is to provide announcements of upcoming
    events and useful info for Physics Undergrads at the University of Texas at Austin. If you
    have any suggestions, please <a href="mailto:sps@physics.utexas.edu">email us</a>.</font></p>

    We here at the SPS are working for you! Currently we are planning a career workshop for sometime in
early April. Companies will be invited to speak about career opportunities for math and physics majors.
Kinda like the Natural Science Career Fair, but without all the CS stuff. More details to come...

    This past weekend, Dr. Oakes and a group of dedicated physics majors (including our own Liz, John,
and Dipak) braved the elements to teach youngsters and their parents about the fun of physics. A hearty
thank you to everyone involved in dissemanating physics to the masses.

    We like talking to people. We especially like hearing
comments/suggestions/wishes/desires from our fellow SPS members. So drop us a line.

      <p><font face="Helvetica">This is...well... this is something. Suffice it to say that the
people who wrote this tome many moons ago had a lot of free time on their hands (notice how they
actually took the time to put 'new' names on the comic strips before scanning them in). At the
very least it's interesting and somewhat informative.</font></p>

    <h3><font face="Arial">SPS Membership Information</font></h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Helvetica">Here's the thing, you wanna be a member? You're a member. One of these days
we're going to charge dues, but not this semester. So enjoy it while it lasts. I should also mention that we do 
not require that you be a
      member at the national level, though it is preferred, and we think you'll like the benefit
      of receiving Physics Today. To apply for the national organization, please pick up a form
      from on top of the filing cabinet in the SPS lounge (RLM 5.222) and send it to the listed
      address, along with $15.00.</p>
