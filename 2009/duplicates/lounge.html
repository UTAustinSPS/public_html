<h1>Physics Undergraduate Lounge</h1>
<h3>RLM 5.222</h3>
<p>
The Physics Undergraduate Lounge is located next to the Kodosky Reading Room* and opposite to Pat Morgan's office on the 5th floor. It is open to all undergraduate physics majors. Simply see Pat Morgan or one of the officers about getting access. The room features:
<ul>
<li><b>Coffee!</b> Hot and fresh on the honor system! Please <a href="coffee.html">follow the instructions</a> so as not to make a mess."</li>
<li><b>Lockers:</b> Bring your own lock. Label your locker with your name and the current school year.</li>
<li><b>Refrigerator, Microwave, Stove and Sink</b>: Bring your lunch and keep it cold in SPS refrigerator. Lunch hot or cold. Open sodas and leftover pizza are free for the taking. The sink is new; kindly do not dispose of food in it, or it will clog.</li>
<li><b>Food and Drink:</b> Available for purchase on the honor system. Check the fridge and tables for reasonably priced sodas, coffee, and snacks. We can't replace them fast enough! If you would like to be involved in stocking the lounge and/or expanding the selection of goods, please contact Philip Thomas (check UT directory).</li>
<li><b>Library:</b> There are many books ranging from incredibly useful (entry level references) to generally unehelpful (bad fiction or graduate level). We ask that you keep items in the room. It is our plan to organize these texts in the future, but we will probably need professor help.</li>
<li><b>Computer:</b> There is a working old school Apple G2 with internet access.</li>
<li><b>Phone</b>: In the era before the cell phone, this was perhaps a really big deal, but keeping with the old <a href="survival/index.shtml">guide</a>, "Don't pay for (local) phone calls! To make an on-campus call from the lounge, dial the last five digits of the number. To make an off-campus call from the lounge, dial 9 first, then the local number. Campus Directory Information: 471-3434."</li>
</ul>
*There is free coffee available in the Kodosky Reading Room, but you are required to drink it there, and partaking of food is not allowed.
