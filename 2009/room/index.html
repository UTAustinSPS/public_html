Lounge</h1>

<p>
The Physics Undergraduate Lounge is located next to the Kodosky Reading
Room and opposite to Pat Morgan's office on the 5th floor. It is open
to all undergraduate physics majors. See Pat Morgan or one of
the officers about getting access, or come to a meeting !</p>
<p><strong>The room features:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Coffee!</b>&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Lockers:</b> Bring your own lock. Label your
locker with your name and the current school year.</li>
<li><b>Refrigerator, Microwave and Sink</b>: Bring
your lunch
and keep it cold in SPS refrigerator. Lunch hot or cold. Open sodas and
leftover pizza are free for the taking. The sink is new; kindly do not
dispose of food in it, or it will clog.</li>
<li><b>Food and Drink:</b> Available for purchase
on the honor system.
Check the fridge and tables for reasonably priced sodas, snacks, and
other things.&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Library:</b> There are many books ranging
from incredibly useful
(entry level references) to generally unhelpful (bad fiction or
graduate level). We ask that you keep items in the room.&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Computer:</b> There is a working old school
Apple G2 with internet access.</li>
<li><b>Phone</b>: In the era before the cell phone,
this was perhaps a really big deal, but keeping with the old<a href="Resources.html"> </a><a target="_blank" href="../survival/index.shtml">guide</a>,
"Don't pay for (local) phone calls! To make an on-campus call from the
lounge, dial the last five digits of the number. To make an off-campus
call from the lounge, dial 9 first, then the local number. Campus
Directory Information: 471-3434."</li>
</ul>
Note: there is free coffee available in the Kodosky Reading Room, but
you
are required to drink it there, and partaking of food is not allowed.
&nbsp;Also, for you tea drinkers and french press users, there is
boiling hot water out of the coffee brewer.<br>
