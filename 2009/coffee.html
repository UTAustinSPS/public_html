<h1>How to Make Coffee</h1>
<p>It is a dark and stormy night. You and your buddies are craving that cup of joe to get you through deriving the Clebsch-Gordon table, so you try to work the friendly neighborhood coffeemaker only to spill wet grounds and drip coffee everywhere. You suffer third-degree burns and electrical shock. Worse, your popularity in the department plummets when everyone finds out what a klutz you are. Don't let it happen to you.</p>
<p>Operating the coffee maker is a non-trivial task, especially for someone like myself that grew up on a coffee-free childhood. Thankfully I watched this great movie with Matt Damon and Ben Affleck called The Coffee House Rules, and now I share this obtained wisdom with you. There is nothing sexier than making coffee no fuss no muss, so listen up and stay in school.</p>
<p><b>Do I have time to make coffee?</b><br>
You will need around ten minutes to wait for the coffee to drip, or it will continue to drip on the hot plate after you remove the carafe.</p>
<p><b>How much to make?</b><br>
If there is enough in the pot, don't waste it by making more! If it is between 7 A.M. and 5 P.M., feel free to make a pot. After hours, make only as much as necessary. 8 oz. is a standard cup in coffeemaker units, but coffee mugs are actually 12 oz.</p>
<p><b>Directions:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Is it on? If it is, turn it off and be careful as you remove the carafe and tray. It may hiss ominously when you touch it, but do not display fear or drop it.</li>
<li>Scrub out the carafe and rinse the tray in the sink.</li>
<li>Place the filter in the tray and wet it so it sticks (like chemistry lab).</li>
<li>Measure half a measuring cup for every 8 oz. cup. Fill it over the sink, as grounds have a mind of their own and spill themselves.</li>
<li>Using the provided 8 oz. cup, add water through the grate slowly so it does not spill.</li>
<li>Turn on and wait for the drip to stop.</li>
<li>Remove the tray. The coffeemaker may hiss at you in an attempt to protect its young, but again, keep a brave face as you place the filter in the trash (watch the grounds).</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><b>Should I leave the coffeemaker on?</b><br>
If you have made excess coffee, leave it on so it stays warm. After hours, you should have made just enough, so turn it off. It should be fairly obvious to the reader that if you empty the pot, you should also turn it off.</p>
<p>Practice makes perfect. You can use these guidelines generally not just in the Lounge, but also in your workplace of choice, as long as it features a coffeemaker (highly likely).</p>
